# How can we run with another trades? 

First of them, you should view the [script.js](https://github.com/bgebes/binance-live-chart-application-js/blob/gh-pages/script.js#L2). And you can change the variable about trades.

# How often data getting to there?

As written in script, data is getting 0.5s to there. I don't recommend(some communication problems with servers) but you can change this frequency from [script.js](https://github.com/bgebes/binance-live-chart-application-js/blob/gh-pages/script.js#L35). Don't forget, a second equals 1000 milisecond and scripts accept milisecond as unit for time.
